Here We will see some of the basics SQL queries which is essential for development
//CRUD Operations
1. Create a Product Table:-

CREATE TABLE products(
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name STRING,
    price MONEY,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);

2. Insert some data into Product Table:- 

INSERT INTO products
VALUES (1, 'Pen', 1.20);

Or,

INSERT INTO products (id, name, price)
VALUES (1, 'Pen', 1.20);

3. Read data from Product Table:-

SELECT * FROM products;

Or,

SELECT name, price FROM products;

4. WHERE clause

SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1;

5. Update values from Product Table:-

UPDATE products 
SET price = 0.80
WHERE id=2;

6. If we add another column named Stock:-

ALTER TABLE products
ADD stock INT;

7. Delete records from the Product Table:-

DELETE FROM products
WHERE id=2;

8. Make a Orders Table and add a foreign key of product id:-

CREATE orders(
    id INT NOT NULL,
    order_number INT,
    product_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES products(id)
);

--just enter some values in the order table--
INSERT INTO orders
VALUES 
(1, 4362, 1),
(2, 2346, 1);

10. How to join the Product and Order Table with using INNER JOIN:-
SELECT orders.order_number, products.name, products.price, products.stock
FROM orders
INNER JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.id;
